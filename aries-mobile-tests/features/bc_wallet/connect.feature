   Scenario Outline: Holder is waiting for Connection (failure)
      Given the holder has a valid QR code invitation (is it true that the QR code is valid in this case?)
      When they scan the QR code invitation
      #(I don't think we need (but you can) state they are waiting, that is a side effect of the scan)
      And the connection fails to be established for <reason>
      Then a temporary error notification (toast) is displayed <error message> (are there specific errors for the different reasons?)
      And they are taken back to the home screen (I'd reframe this to taken, so it is not misinterpreted that the user manually goes back to the home screen)

      Examples:
         | reason                                     | error message                |
         | timeout?                                   | this is taking too long man! |
         | no internet connectivity at point of scan? | No internet                  |
         | what other reasons?                        | I don't know                 |

   #I think this is obsolete
